# Console

The EasyWebhook packages provides the following console command:

- `easy-webhooks:send-due-webhooks`

## Send due webhooks

The `easy-webhooks:send-due-webhooks` command finds stored webhooks that are due to be sent, i.e. webhooks that were not
sent because they had the `$sendAfter` property set to a date and time in the future, but can now be sent because the
`$sendAfter` date and time has passed.

Note that the webhook store must implement `EonX\EasyWebhook\Common\Store\SendAfterStoreInterface` in order to be
able to find due webhooks. Of the stores provided by the EasyWebhook package, only the Doctrine DBAL webhook store
supports finding due webhooks.

The command has the following options:

- `--bulk`: Number of webhooks to send.
- `--sendAfter`: DateTime to start fetching due webhooks from, in "Y-m-d H:i:s" format.
- `--timezone`: The time zone of the `sendAfter` DateTime, given as a valid [tz database][1] name, e.g.
  `Australia/Melbourne`.
