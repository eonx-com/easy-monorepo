The purpose of this package isn't to be used within a project by the application as there is no point in creating
another level of abstraction in that case BUT only to allow eonx-com packages to dispatch events without
having to think about the event dispatcher used by each of our projects.

### Require package (Composer)

The recommended way to install this package is to use [Composer][1]:

```bash
$ composer require eonx-com/easy-lock
```
